//! Send and receive data over lossy streams of bytes.
//!
//! Living in / inspired by the [data link layer][dll] or layer 2
//! in the OSI networking model, this module enables sending slices of
//! bytes of definite length over an underlying lossy transport that
//! only supports sending an unstructured stream of bytes (a [physical
//! layer][pl], such as ITM, UART or SPI).
//!
//! [dll]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer
//! [pl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer
//!
//! The transport may corrupt the stream by dropping or modifying some
//! bytes en route. When the transport returns corrupt data the
//! decoder may return errors or corrupted payloads, but if the
//! transport starts operating without losses again the decoder should
//! return new uncorrupted frames.
//!
//! See the `bytes` or `typed` modules to send and receive raw slices
//! of bytes or serialized structs respectively.
//!
//! ## Encoding
//!
//! Currently the encoding is:
//!
//! * Frame [COBS]-encoded to remove bytes equal to zero
//!   * Payload: supplied by user
//!   * Footer:
//!     * A checksum computed over the payload. The type of checksum depends
//!       on the configuration in `framed::bytes::Config`.
//! * A terminating zero byte.
//!
//! [COBS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing
//!
//! The encoding is not stable at the moment, i.e. it can and will
//! change between minor versions. Consequently encoded data from this
//! crate is unsuitable for long-term storage or transmission between
//! different versions of an application. The API should be kept
//! stable between versions where possible and the crate version will
//! follow Rust semver rules on API changes.
//!
//! ## Cargo feature flags
//!
//! `use_std`: Use standard library. Enabled by default, disable for no_std.
//!
//! `use_nightly`:  Enables unstable features that only work on nightly rust.
//!                 Required for practical no_std use.
//!
//! `trace`: Enable to print all data to stdout for testing.
//!
//! ## Byte slice wrapper types
//!
//! Payload data and encoded frame data are both slices of bytes but
//! have separate types to help avoid mixing them up. You are
//! encouraged to use these types in your own code when integrating
//! with this crate. Definitions:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! /// Arbitrary user data.
//! pub type Payload = [u8];
//!
//! /// Data that is encoded as a frame. It is ready to send, or may have
//! /// just been received.
//! pub type Encoded = [u8];
//!
//! /// A buffer that is used as temporary storage.
//! /// There are no guarantees on its contents after use.
//! pub type TempBuffer = [u8];
//!
//! /// Heap-allocated user data used as a return type.
//! #[cfg(feature = "use_std")]
//! pub struct BoxPayload(_);
//!
//! /// Heap-allocated frame data used as a return type.
//! #[cfg(feature = "use_std")]
//! pub struct BoxEncoded(_);
//! ```
//!
//! Note that data typed as `Payload` or `Encoded` may be
//! efficiently passed as a function argument by reference, but is
//! returned using an opaque struct (`BoxPayload`, `BoxEncoded`)
//! containing a heap-allocated value instead. Consequently `encode_*`
//! and `decode_*` variants that require this are only available with
//! the `use_std` Cargo feature.
